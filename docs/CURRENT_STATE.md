# TokenMaster current state

## Product identity

TokenMaster is the sole product. It is an original Rust/Slint/SQLite implementation
in one root workspace. WhereMyTokens is the UI/product reference and ccusage is the
usage-analysis reference; both remain external, MIT-pinned provenance only.

## Implemented

- M0 native architecture proof: one process, software-rendered Slint UI, tray
  lifecycle, three layouts, three skins, English/Russian/pseudo localization,
  bounded chart/session models, and explicit resource-gate contracts.
- M1 usage foundation: bounded provider roots, path-private source discovery,
  reparse-safe streaming enumeration, typed bounded JSONL parser, cumulative token
  state, physical/logical source identity, byte framing, revalidation, strict SQLite
  usage schema, keyset reads, and atomic current-generation append.

## Next implementation slice

Implement invisible staging generations, atomic promotion, and safe scan epochs. A
staging write must never affect canonical events. Promotion must replace one current
generation atomically, and only a completed scan may mark unseen sources missing.

## Release truth

M0 is not accepted. The required interactive Windows/DPI/accessibility receipt and an
uninterrupted 24-hour software-soak receipt are absent. No package, signing, or
product-release claim is authorized by the current developer evidence.

The clean-root audit, all three Pester contract files, root format check, strict
Clippy with `RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings`, full locked Rust workspace tests, release build,
and M0 developer stress verification pass from the root workspace. The exact commands
are recorded in `docs/HANDOFF.md` and the M0 script; this does not replace external
acceptance evidence.
