# TokenMaster recovery playbook

1. Confirm the current branch and clean worktree with `git status --short`.
2. Read `AGENTS.md`, the contracts in `spec/`, and `docs/HANDOFF.md`.
3. Run `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts\audit-clean-root.ps1 -RepositoryRoot (Get-Location).Path`.
4. Run the focused test for the affected crate before changing behavior.
5. If source data or SQLite state is involved, preserve user data and reproduce with a
   synthetic fixture; never persist or attach private JSONL content.
6. Run the workspace gate before updating handoff documents.

Generated `target/`, `reports/`, and `dist/` content is disposable developer output.
Do not use it as a release claim. M0 acceptance requires the exact external receipts
listed in `M0_ACCEPTANCE.md`.
