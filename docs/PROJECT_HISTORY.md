# TokenMaster project history

## 2026-07-14 — clean TokenMaster foundation

The repository was established as a single-root Rust project. It retains the active
TokenMaster source, tests, resource gates, external-reference provenance, and a
fresh product documentation set. The product is independently implemented; external
references are used for requirement analysis only.

The root audit, Pester contracts, strict Rust linting, complete locked workspace test,
release build, and M0 developer stress gate were revalidated after the root transition.
Interactive and long-run acceptance evidence remains open.

## Architecture milestones

- M0 selected and proved Rust 1.97, Slint 1.17, bundled SQLite, the software renderer,
bounded models, native tray lifecycle, modular skins, layouts, and localization.
- M1 established bounded Codex discovery, streaming parse/revalidation, strict
path-private SQLite storage, checkpoint CAS, and atomic current-generation ingest.
- M1 staging-generation promotion and scan reconciliation remain deliberately
unimplemented until their transactional contract tests are written.
