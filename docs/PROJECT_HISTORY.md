# TokenMaster project history

## 2026-07-14 — clean TokenMaster foundation

The repository was established as a single-root Rust project. It retains the active
TokenMaster source, tests, resource gates, external-reference provenance, and a
fresh product documentation set. The product is independently implemented; external
references are used for requirement analysis only.

The root audit, Pester contracts, strict Rust linting, complete locked workspace test,
release build, and M0 developer stress gate were revalidated after the root transition.
Interactive and long-run acceptance evidence remains open.

## 2026-07-14 — product architecture and automation design

A complete Codex-first product design was selected for written review. It retains the
Rust/Slint/SQLite architecture, adds replay-correct canonical accounting before
analytics, defines immutable shared query snapshots, and isolates a universal local
MCP stdio connector in a separate on-demand process. Hermes, Codex, Claude Code,
Gemini CLI, and OpenCode consume the same bounded typed tools and advisory automation
decisions; no daemon or HTTP listener is part of 1.0.

The same design specifies the six-section desktop board, provider-defined dynamic
quota bars, independent skin/layout/density/color-scheme/locale axes, bounded
declarative skin inheritance, complete English/Russian localization, performance,
privacy, conformance, and delivery gates. This milestone is design-only and does not
claim those surfaces are implemented.

## Architecture milestones

- M0 selected and proved Rust 1.97, Slint 1.17, bundled SQLite, the software renderer,
bounded models, native tray lifecycle, modular skins, layouts, and localization.
- M1 established bounded Codex discovery, streaming parse/revalidation, strict
path-private SQLite storage, checkpoint CAS, and atomic current-generation ingest.
- M1 staging-generation promotion and scan reconciliation remain deliberately
unimplemented until their transactional contract tests are written.
