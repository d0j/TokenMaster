# TokenMaster project history

## 2026-07-14 — clean TokenMaster foundation

The repository was established as a single-root Rust project. It retains the active
TokenMaster source, tests, resource gates, external-reference provenance, and a
fresh product documentation set. The product is independently implemented; external
references are used for requirement analysis only.

The root audit, Pester contracts, strict Rust linting, complete locked workspace test,
release build, and M0 developer stress gate were revalidated after the root transition.
Interactive and long-run acceptance evidence remains open.

## 2026-07-14 — product architecture and automation design

A complete Codex-first product design was selected for written review. It retains the
Rust/Slint/SQLite architecture, adds replay-correct canonical accounting before
analytics, defines immutable shared query snapshots, and isolates a universal local
MCP stdio connector in a separate on-demand process. Hermes, Codex, Claude Code,
Gemini CLI, and OpenCode consume the same bounded typed tools and advisory automation
decisions; no daemon or HTTP listener is part of 1.0.

The same design specifies the six-section desktop board, provider-defined dynamic
quota bars, independent skin/layout/density/color-scheme/locale axes, bounded
declarative skin inheritance, complete English/Russian localization, performance,
privacy, conformance, and delivery gates. This milestone is design-only and does not
claim those surfaces are implemented.

The design was approved with execution ordered by correctness first: replay-safe
canonical accounting, then staging/runtime engine, with automation connector and
presentation work later. A provider-neutral source-adapter seam was added so local
Codex JSONL is the first bounded adapter rather than a dependency of the store,
queries, automation, or UI. The detailed P0 TDD plan is recorded in
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-14-tokenmaster-p0-replay-correctness.md`; this planning
milestone changes no runtime behavior.

The approved replay and provider-neutral source boundaries were normalized into the
authoritative product, data, security, decision, traceability, and roadmap documents.
Local Codex remains the only implemented reader. Canonical replay disposition,
source-adapter engine ports, and complete-scan tail finalization remain implementation
work; this contract step changes no executable behavior.

Contract verification:

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File scripts\audit-clean-root.ps1
git diff --check
```

The clean-root audit returned `TM-CLEAN-PASS`, the diff check exited zero, and the
changed contracts contained no unfinished drafting markers.

## 2026-07-14 — replay lineage domain contract

Added provider-neutral fixed-size replay signatures, strong/weak evidence, bounded
parent session identity, zero-based ordinal, and an explicit declared-conflict bit.
The replay signature has redacted debug output and rejects non-32-byte deserialization;
self-parenting is accepted only when already marked conflict. Canonical events do not
carry the new value yet, so no runtime accounting claim is made.

Verification:

```powershell
cargo test -p tokenmaster-domain --test usage_contract replay_lineage_is_bounded_serializable_and_private
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test -p tokenmaster-domain
git diff --check
```

The focused test first failed on missing replay types, then passed after the minimal
implementation. All domain tests, formatting, and the diff check passed.

## 2026-07-14 — sandboxed provider plugin architecture

Selected a future language-neutral provider extension system: Codex stays compiled in
as the zero-overhead default adapter, while external `.tmplugin` WebAssembly
Components run one package per isolated on-demand host process. Native DLL/executable
plugins and plugin-provided UI are excluded. Packages use a versioned WIT API, strict
manifest/signature/permission rules, scoped host capabilities, transactional hot
replacement, quarantine, and explicit process/guest resource gates.

Providers return bounded observation drafts. A shared TokenMaster canonicalizer owns
fingerprints, replay signatures/evidence, event IDs, and canonical-event construction,
so neither built-in nor external providers can bypass accounting rules. The design is
recorded in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-14-tokenmaster-provider-plugin-system-design.md`.
This milestone changes no plugin runtime behavior; the current P0 plan requires a
written revision before Codex signature implementation continues.

Design verification:

```powershell
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -File scripts\audit-clean-root.ps1
git diff --check
```

The clean-root audit returned `TM-CLEAN-PASS`; the diff check, unfinished-marker scan,
obsolete-contract scan, and sensitive-marker scan all passed.

## Architecture milestones

- M0 selected and proved Rust 1.97, Slint 1.17, bundled SQLite, the software renderer,
bounded models, native tray lifecycle, modular skins, layouts, and localization.
- M1 established bounded Codex discovery, streaming parse/revalidation, strict
path-private SQLite storage, checkpoint CAS, and atomic current-generation ingest.
- M1 staging-generation promotion and scan reconciliation remain deliberately
unimplemented until their transactional contract tests are written.
