# TokenMaster handoff

## First five minutes

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, then the `spec/` files in its declared order.
2. Confirm `git status --short` is empty and use a feature branch or worktree.
3. Run the clean-root audit and the focused test for the next requirement.
4. Do not infer an interactive or release result from developer-only evidence.

## Current implementation boundary

P0-A and the incorporated P0-B Codex-lineage surface are complete under
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-14-tokenmaster-p0-authority-boundary.md`. The P0-C pure
classifier is complete under
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-14-tokenmaster-p0-c-replay-classifier.md`. P0-D schema
v2, exact-v1 immutable migration, explicit archive state, fixed-manifest staging, and
classified replay append are implemented under
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-14-tokenmaster-p0-d-replay-archive.md`. The immediate
next task is bounded durable late-relation/descendant continuation; seal/promotion
follows. The complete approved order is in `docs/AUDIT_AND_MASTER_PLAN.md`.

Tasks 3+ in `2026-07-14-tokenmaster-p0-replay-correctness.md` are superseded. Do not
execute its Codex-owned fingerprint/signature or destructive migration steps. Do not
add Wasmtime to the GUI or current Codex path.

Codex parser resume v1 is deliberately rejected: it cannot recover a trustworthy
event ordinal. Do not reinterpret it as ordinal zero. P0-D must preserve the old
archive read-only and build v2 state in a separate staging generation.

Do not expose a staging revision as current truth. Replay append advances a
store-owned evidence epoch and must reject stale CAS, altered duplicate observations,
or mixed accounting versions atomically. Promotion is not implemented yet.

## Commands

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts\audit-clean-root.ps1 -RepositoryRoot (Get-Location).Path
cargo +1.97.0 test -p tokenmaster-store --test usage_ingest_contract --locked
cargo +1.97.0 test -p tokenmaster-accounting --locked

```

For M0 developer evidence, Pester 5.7.1 and a validated GNU linker are required:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts\verify-m0.ps1 -RepositoryRoot (Get-Location).Path
```

The P0 authority/lineage/classifier slices passed focused contracts, full locked
workspace tests, strict workspace Clippy, clean-root, documentation consistency,
privacy, formatting, and diff gates on 2026-07-14. This does not accept M0 or package
a product release. See `M0_ACCEPTANCE.md`.
