# TokenMaster traceability

Status values are explicit: `implemented`, `partial`, `planned`, or `open evidence`.
A design or plan is not implementation evidence.

| TM-UI-002 | partial | `crates/probe-app` presentation generations | presentation/skin contracts; archive-independent product snapshots pending |
| TM-PERF-001 | partial | parser, reader, domain, store bounds, P0-E composition, and P1-C.1 one-active/one-follow-up coordinator | 300-file/300-event, 256-batch/page, reopen, and 10,000-hint constant-state contracts pass; future adapter/query/plugin bounds pending |
| TM-PERF-002 | open evidence | software renderer and M0 resource gates | uninterrupted soak and interactive receipts remain absent |
| TM-PERF-003 | partial | keyset store reads implemented; immutable snapshots planned | SQLite/read contracts; P2 query snapshot gates pending |
| TM-REL-001 | partial | M0 scripts and receipt schemas | identity checks exist; final product packaging evidence pending |

| TM-DATA-001 | partial | domain/provider/Codex/store privacy boundaries | adversarial/debug/path privacy tests; future surfaces must repeat gates |
| TM-DATA-002 | implemented | domain drafts plus exclusive `tokenmaster-accounting` canonicalizer | canonicalizer vectors, compile-fail authority tests, Codex/store contracts |
| TM-DATA-003 | implemented | file identity and reader checkpoint | physical identity live/persisted round-trip, checkpoint conversion, resume bound, and restart contracts |
| TM-DATA-004 | implemented | atomic current append, scoped complete-only scan finalization, scan-bound and compatibility staging, bounded reference-safe scan pruning, exact preparation, paged seal, retained projection promotion, and staging discard | lifecycle/begin-fault/membership/reopen/zero-source/300-source/repeated-scan/backlog/Codex pipeline contracts pass |
| TM-DATA-005 | implemented | `crates/store/src/usage` | strict schema v5, exact v1/v2/v3/v4 migration, provider-qualified scan sets, pragmas, keyset paging, ingest contracts |
| TM-DATA-006 | partial | reader/parser/store limits | line/resume/batch/page bounds; full UI/query/plugin limits pending |
| TM-DATA-007 | implemented | replay facts/classifier in a private overlay plus schema-v4 self-contained canonical projection with deterministic selection/retention | v1/v2/v3-to-v4 migration plus replay/append/restart/300-file/atomic-replacement/truncation truth-table/failure contracts pass |
| TM-SEC-001 | partial | local-only product and no listener today | future quota HTTPS opt-in and MCP stdio security tests pending |
| TM-SEC-002 | partial | current JSONL/store boundaries validate types and sizes | future config/CLI/MCP/plugin boundary suites pending |
| TM-SEC-003 | implemented | provider/Codex/store errors and value types | serialized/debug privacy and path-redaction contracts |
| TM-SEC-004 | partial | transactional scoped scan and replay authority, bounded reference-safe pruning, CAS/preparation, immutable legacy, exact paged seal, explicit carry-forward, atomic rollback, and exact-epoch discard | P1-B proves complete-only presence, exact binding, zero-source retention, 32/64 pruning bounds, running/reference preservation, and fault rollback; live runtime remains |
| TM-SEC-005 | partial | M0 skins are declarative application data | external skin package schema/validation not implemented |
| TM-SEC-006 | planned | built-in Codex exists; isolated plugin host deferred | provider plugin design and future 1.1 conformance/security gates |

The approved audit resolutions and delivery order are in
`docs/AUDIT_AND_MASTER_PLAN.md`. P0-A/P0-B and P0-C have completed executable plans.
P0-D transaction, classification, seal, promotion, rollback, and recovery semantics
are implemented. P0-D.1 removed the historical 256-file product blocker with exact
schema-v2-to-v3 migration, disk-backed all-source begin, checked 64-bit counts, and
256-row keyset-paged validation. P0-E proves the real synthetic Codex-to-archive path,
including bounded restart, atomic replacement, failure discard, totals, and quality.
P1-A adds schema-v4 provenance and explicit prior-evidence carry-forward without
retaining obsolete generations. P1-B.1 adds strict schema v5 and provider-qualified,
complete-only scan-set presence authority. P1-B.2 binds the production replay and
real synthetic Codex composition to that authority, including zero-source retention.
P1-B.3 bounds closed scan history to 32 per scope with 64-set reference-safe batches,
running recovery, checked ID exhaustion, and atomic fault rollback. The production
runtime engine remains P1-C and later.
Tasks 3+ in the older replay plan are historical and superseded.

The clean-root invariant is implemented by `scripts/audit-clean-root.ps1` and its
Pester contracts.
