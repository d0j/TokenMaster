# TokenMaster traceability

Status values are explicit: `implemented`, `partial`, `planned`, or `open evidence`.
A design or plan is not implementation evidence.

The approved audit resolutions and delivery order are in
`docs/AUDIT_AND_MASTER_PLAN.md`. P0-A/P0-B and P0-C have completed executable plans.
P0-D transaction, classification, seal, promotion, rollback, and recovery semantics
are implemented. P0-D.1 removed the historical 256-file product blocker with exact
schema-v2-to-v3 migration, disk-backed all-source begin, checked 64-bit counts, and
256-row keyset-paged validation. P0-E proves the real synthetic Codex-to-archive path,
including bounded restart, atomic replacement, failure discard, totals, and quality.
P1-A adds schema-v4 provenance and explicit prior-evidence carry-forward without
retaining obsolete generations. P1-B.1 adds strict schema v5 and provider-qualified,
complete-only scan-set presence authority. P1-B.2 binds the production replay and
real synthetic Codex composition to that authority, including zero-source retention.
P1-B.3 bounds closed scan history to 32 per scope with 64-set reference-safe batches,
running recovery, checked ID exhaustion, and atomic fault rollback. P1-C.1 and P1-C.2
provide constant-state refresh admission plus bounded provider-neutral runtime ports.
P1-C.3 composes them into a scope-exact, bounded one-shot execution with full phase
cancellation/deadline coverage and exact replay cleanup. P1-C.4 completes the engine
core with one owned worker thread, capacity-one wake/latest-result channels, fixed
supersession state, panic/fault containment, stale-ID safety, and cancel/wake/join
shutdown/Drop ownership. P1-D.0 then corrects the real multi-file seam with a fixed
logical-file key and two linear streaming passes that lend at most one temporary
reader; the 300-file contract proves no engine replay-page/descriptor collection.
P1-D.1 applies replay events and late relations as one bounded atomic fact batch with
two rollback boundaries and one epoch increment. P1-D.2 now supplies the real
path-private Codex adapter, strict checkpoint codec, and store archive bootstrap
composition. P1-D.3 now adds schema v6 publication truth, exact scan freshness/source
admission, paired-CAS replay-aware tail append, bounded continuation, durable partial/
recovery state, and real Codex zero-payload/append/multi-batch/restart/replacement
plus profile-scope/full-rebuild recovery contracts. P1-D.4 adds the portable empty-
sidecar process-owned writer lease, mapped-remote fail-closed classification, and a
4,096-cycle Windows handle-plateau contract. P1-D.5 bounded watcher/scheduler is next,
followed by lifecycle assembly.
Tasks 3+ in the older replay plan are historical and superseded.

The clean-root invariant is implemented by `scripts/audit-clean-root.ps1` and its
Pester contracts.
