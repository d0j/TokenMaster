# TokenMaster traceability

Status values are explicit: `implemented`, `partial`, `planned`, or `open evidence`.
A design or plan is not implementation evidence.

The approved audit resolutions and delivery order are in
`docs/AUDIT_AND_MASTER_PLAN.md`. P0-A/P0-B and P0-C have completed executable plans.
P0-D transaction, classification, seal, promotion, rollback, and recovery semantics
are implemented. P0-D.1 removed the historical 256-file product blocker with exact
schema-v2-to-v3 migration, disk-backed all-source begin, checked 64-bit counts, and
256-row keyset-paged validation. P0-E proves the real synthetic Codex-to-archive path,
including bounded restart, atomic replacement, failure discard, totals, and quality.
P1-A adds schema-v4 provenance and explicit prior-evidence carry-forward without
retaining obsolete generations. P1-B.1 adds strict schema v5 and provider-qualified,
complete-only scan-set presence authority. P1-B.2 binds the production replay and
real synthetic Codex composition to that authority, including zero-source retention.
P1-B.3 bounds closed scan history to 32 per scope with 64-set reference-safe batches,
running recovery, checked ID exhaustion, and atomic fault rollback. P1-C.1 and P1-C.2
provide constant-state refresh admission plus bounded provider-neutral runtime ports.
P1-C.3 composes them into a scope-exact, bounded one-shot execution with full phase
cancellation/deadline coverage and exact replay cleanup. P1-C.4 completes the engine
core with one owned worker thread, capacity-one wake/latest-result channels, fixed
supersession state, panic/fault containment, stale-ID safety, and cancel/wake/join
shutdown/Drop ownership. P1-D.0 then corrects the real multi-file seam with a fixed
logical-file key and two linear streaming passes that lend at most one temporary
reader; the 300-file contract proves no engine replay-page/descriptor collection.
P1-D.1 applies replay events and late relations as one bounded atomic fact batch with
two rollback boundaries and one epoch increment. P1-D.2 now supplies the real
path-private Codex adapter, strict checkpoint codec, and store archive bootstrap
composition. P1-D.3 now adds schema v6 publication truth, exact scan freshness/source
admission, paired-CAS replay-aware tail append, bounded continuation, durable partial/
recovery state, and real Codex zero-payload/append/multi-batch/restart/replacement
plus profile-scope/full-rebuild recovery contracts. P1-D.4 adds the portable empty-
sidecar process-owned writer lease, mapped-remote fail-closed classification, and a
4,096-cycle Windows handle-plateau contract. P1-D.5 adds the pinned pathless watcher,
fixed atomic aggregate, quiet/periodic scheduler, 10,000-hint one-follow-up proof, and
32-generation Windows resource return. P1-D.6 adds lease-first startup recovery,
incremental/rebuild selection, admission-safe pause/resume, current-partial restart,
ordered joined shutdown, and combined Windows resource return. P1-E.1 now adds
startup-seeded immutable engine publication, strict archive-generation ordering,
exact revision/scan/data-through, fixed checked diagnostics, 10,000 equal-candidate
retention, and busy/older-result rejection. P1-E.2 closes no-change, pause/resume,
process-restart, malformed-truncation `recovery_pending`, canonical-retention, and
successful-repair publication contracts. P1-E.3 adds real Windows callback
registration, capacity-one event reduction, resume-without-suspend reconciliation,
duplicate/shutdown behavior, and 4,096-cycle private-memory/handle/thread/USER/GDI
resource bounds. P1 and P2-A are implemented; M0 interactive/soak and P2-B product-data
evidence remain.
Tasks 3+ in the older replay plan are historical and superseded.

The clean-root invariant is implemented by `scripts/audit-clean-root.ps1` and its
Pester contracts.
