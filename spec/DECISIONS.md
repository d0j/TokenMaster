# TokenMaster decisions

## ADR-001 — Single-root native workspace

Decision: TokenMaster has one root Rust workspace. Rationale: one build graph,
unambiguous ownership, no cross-project runtime dependency, and reliable verification.

## ADR-002 — Reference hierarchy

Decision: WhereMyTokens guides UI/product completeness and ccusage guides usage
analysis completeness. Rationale: requirements are taken from mature user-facing
behavior while TokenMaster keeps its own safe, bounded implementation.

## ADR-003 — Rust, Slint, and SQLite

Decision: Rust 1.97, Slint 1.17, and bundled SQLite are the product stack. Rationale:
native portable deployment, predictable ownership, declarative reactive UI, and
transactional local storage.

## ADR-004 — Presentation isolation

Decision: skins, layouts, and locales are declarative presentation state over immutable
snapshots. Rationale: instant switching without archive mutation, reparsing, or stale
asynchronous overwrite.

## ADR-005 — Incremental archive with staging

Decision: stream bounded source data into a strict SQLite archive; use invisible
staging generations for replacement/reconciliation. Rationale: fast append paths,
crash consistency, deterministic canonical selection, and safe rollback.

## ADR-006 — M0 gates remain hard

Decision: bounded M1 work may continue while M0 external evidence is open, but no M0
acceptance or package claim is permitted. Rationale: development can progress without
weakening real interactive and long-run validation.

## ADR-007 — Explicit replay lineage before analytics

Decision: canonical totals are selected from retained observations using explicit
session ancestry, versioned structural replay signatures, and fail-closed
pending/conflict states. Rationale: timestamp/fingerprint deduplication alone cannot
detect copied fork/subagent prefixes, while time or filename heuristics can suppress
legitimate equal-valued usage.

## ADR-008 — Codex-first provider-neutral source seam

Decision: local Codex discovery/reader/decoder is the only 1.0 ingestion adapter, but
engine and downstream crates consume provider-neutral bounded drafts/snapshots. Codex
is compiled in. Future third-party providers use versioned WebAssembly Components in
one isolated on-demand host process per package; native DLL/executable plugins are not
supported. Rationale: providers can be installed without rebuilding TokenMaster while
the default Codex path stays fast, the GUI carries no Wasmtime runtime, and untrusted
code receives only explicit bounded capabilities.

## ADR-009 — Core-owned canonical identities

Decision: providers emit observation drafts containing normalized facts and replay
basis; a provider-neutral TokenMaster canonicalizer computes fingerprints, replay
signatures/evidence, event IDs, and canonical-event values. Rationale: built-in and
external providers cannot diverge from or bypass accounting identity rules.

Implementation status: active. `tokenmaster-accounting` is the exclusive constructor;
Codex emits drafts/late session relations, and the store accepts opaque canonical
events only. Fingerprint v2 and replay signature v1 are versioned deterministic
framed hashes. The same crate owns the pure bounded replay transition so storage and
providers cannot introduce competing replay semantics.

## ADR-010 — Fail-closed replay promotion and recoverable staging

Decision: a replay revision becomes current only after exact fixed-manifest seal,
zero-pending promotion, and proof that the replacement accounts for every previously
visible event in its evidence overlay or immutable legacy snapshot. Promotion is
one immediate transaction with fault-tested rollback. Failed, obsolete, or
quality-only staging can be discarded only by exact revision/epoch CAS, without
touching current or legacy state. Rationale: rebuilds remain crash-safe and retryable
without allowing partial scans, stale workers, or incomplete replacements to erase
user-visible accounting.

## ADR-011 — SQLite-owned scalable replay manifests

Decision: the product begins a replay revision by snapshotting every registered
source with set-based SQL in one immediate transaction. Revision source counts are
stored and exposed as checked `u64` values within SQLite's signed-integer ceiling, but
never size an application collection. Exact seal and promotion validate deterministic
`file_key` keyset pages of at most 256 rows; continuation uses only a cheap
closed-source aggregate and cannot promote data. The explicit 256-key
`ReplayManifest` remains a bounded test/repair API and cannot seal a subset.

Exact schema v2 archives migrate to v3 by validate, foreign-keys-off outside a
transaction, create-new, copy, drop-old, rename-new, recreate indexes, foreign-key
check, commit, and guaranteed policy restoration. `writable_schema` and
rename-old-first are forbidden. Rationale: normal Codex histories may contain
thousands of JSONL files, so a 256-source product limit is invalid, while collecting
all source identities in Rust would violate the stable-memory target.

## ADR-012 — Adapter-prepared staging and non-destructive replacement

Decision: replay begin remains provider-neutral and creates empty invisible staging,
then the adapter prepares each untouched source through exact revision/epoch CAS using
a validated zero-offset checkpoint with its live path-private physical identity and
valid bounded resume payload. The store never manufactures provider state. A reader
truncate/replace classification does not authorize removal: promotion still requires
coverage of every previously visible event, and an omitted prior event leaves the old
projection current.

Rationale: copying an old physical identity while clearing offsets makes legitimate
atomic replacement unrecoverable, while an empty opaque resume cannot be decoded
after restart. Constrained preparation solves both without coupling SQLite to Codex.
Fail-closed prior coverage prevents a truncated, cancelled, incomplete, or parser-bug
rebuild from erasing real accounted usage; P1 must define explicit carry-forward and
retention authority before continuous reconciliation.

Implementation update: P1-A now supplies that authority through ADR-013. Truncation
and replacement still authorize no deletion; complete promotion uses explicit retained
projection state, while incomplete or cancelled rebuilds remain blocked.

## ADR-013 — Self-contained canonical projection and explicit retention

Decision: schema v4 removes the canonical projection's foreign key to deletable source
observations and records `projection_revision_id`, `origin_revision_id`, and
`retained`. Promotion atomically applies one fixed policy: eligible selection replaces,
replay-only suppresses, conflict-only retains, and absence retains. A retained row
keeps its original source key, generation, offset, event values, and older origin
revision without keeping the obsolete source generation alive or copying it into a
synthetic observation. The publishing revision remains a deferred foreign key and all
projection mutations share the generation/revision transaction.

Unrebuilt legacy rows are not carried into replay-verified totals because v1 identity
and quality cannot safely deduplicate against the new overlay; their immutable legacy
snapshot remains readable separately. Partial, cancelled, pending, stale, or invalid
rebuilds never reach the retention transaction.

Rationale: keeping old generations can retain entire obsolete histories and grow
without bound; attaching old events to a new generation fabricates provenance; copying
the full canonical page into every staging revision doubles large archives. A
self-contained indexed projection with explicit origin/retained state preserves
history in set-based bounded-memory SQL and supports atomic rollback without those
costs or false claims.

## ADR-014 — Provider-qualified scan-set authority

Decision: schema v5 groups one bounded, duplicate-free manifest of
`(provider_id, profile_id)` scopes under a `scan_set_id` and creates one typed child
scan per scope. The store owns observation membership through
`usage_source.last_seen_scan_id`. Only a complete child may derive `missing`; all
other outcomes preserve the prior value. A new source registered after any complete
scan for its scope starts missing until a later complete scan observes it. Ordinary
append has no scan authority. Parent/child creation and complete-only finalization are
immediate transactions with explicit fault rollback.

Historical v4 scans are migrated only when their provider can be derived from exact
referenced sources; otherwise they are isolated as `legacy-unverified`. Replay
revisions have nullable scan-set provenance for migration and bounded test/repair
compatibility, while production begin, continuation, seal, and promotion require and
revalidate one exact complete scan set. Zero-source sets publish retention-only truth
without replacing missing-source generations. Closed scan history is pruned as whole
sets only when unreferenced and older than the newest 32 closed sets for every child
scope. One transaction removes at most 64 sets; running sets and source/replay
references are retained, and backlog recovery repeats the same bounded operation.

Rationale: a profile ID is not globally unique across providers, one archive replay
can cover several scopes, and append activity is not proof of complete enumeration.
A scan set provides one archive-wide authority boundary without retaining a
scan-by-source history table or allowing partial enumeration to erase evidence.
The fixed 32/64 policy keeps steady-state refresh cost and database growth bounded
without a full usage-event foreign-key scan or a history-sized Rust allocation.
